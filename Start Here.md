Welcome to my Leadership Portfolio. This collection represents how I lead teams, deliver capabilities, and create clarity in complex technical environments.

If you're exploring this portfolio for the first time, start with the following:

## 1. How I Lead
A narrative overview of my leadership philosophy and operating model.  
→ [[How I Lead]]

## 2. Portfolio Structure
A high-level map of the four domains that organize my work.  
→ [[Leadership Portfolio Overview]]

## 3. Representative Artifacts
A few good entry points:

This portfolio is designed to be both human-readable and machine-ingestible. Each artifact is lightweight, pragmatic, and intended to support repeatable, high-quality delivery.
