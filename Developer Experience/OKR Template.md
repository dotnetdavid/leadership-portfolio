# Objective
A clear, qualitative statement of the outcome you want to achieve. 
It should describe *impact*, not tasks or solutions.

# Key Results
- KR1: A measurable indicator of progress toward the objective.
- KR2: Another measurable, time-bound outcome.
- KR3: A third metric that reflects meaningful change.

# Notes
- Objectives are qualitative and directional.
- Key Results are quantitative and outcome-focused.
- KRs should not describe tasks, deliverables, or activities.
- Success is binary: each KR is either achieved or not.

# Example
---

# Objective
Improve audit readiness and reduce operational risk across AMI governance.

# Key Results
- Reduce non‑compliant AMIs across 500+ AWS accounts by 80%.
- Increase adoption of standardized AMI patterns to 90%.
- Cut manual remediation effort by 50% through automated workflows.

# Notes
- Objective describes the desired impact.
- Key Results measure the evidence of that impact.
- KRs are outcome-based, not task-based.
