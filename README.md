# Leadership Portfolio — David A. Frey

This repository contains a curated collection of leadership frameworks, templates, and operating artifacts that reflect how I lead engineering teams, drive clarity, and deliver outcomes in complex technical environments.

The portfolio is organized into four domains that represent the core dimensions of my leadership practice:

## Purpose

This portfolio is intentionally:

- **lightweight** — easy to read, easy to use  
- **human-centered** — built for clarity, alignment, and shared understanding  
- **machine-ingestible** — clean Markdown for search, automation, and reuse  
- **practical** — grounded in real-world engineering leadership  

It reflects my belief that effective leadership is built on clarity, empathy, and systems thinking.
